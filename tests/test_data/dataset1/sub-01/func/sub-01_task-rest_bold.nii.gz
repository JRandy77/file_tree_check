arameters

    datapandas.DataFrame, numpy.ndarray, mapping, or sequence

        Input data structure. Either a long-form collection of vectors that can be assigned to named variables or a wide-form dataset that will be internally reshaped.
    x, yvectors or keys in data

        Variables that specify positions on the x and y axes.
    huevector or key in data

        Semantic variable that is mapped to determine the color of plot elements.
    row, colvectors or keys in data

        Variables that define subsets to plot on different facets.
    kind{“hist”, “kde”, “ecdf”}

        Approach for visualizing the data. Selects the underlying plotting function and determines the additional set of valid parameters.
    rugbool

        If True, show each observation with marginal ticks (as in rugplot()).
    rug_kwsdict

        Parameters to control the appearance of the rug plot.
    log_scalebool or number, or pair of bools or numbers

        Set a log scale on the data axis (or axes, with bivariate data) with the given base (default 10), and evaluate the KDE in log space.
    legendbool

        If False, suppress the legend for semantic variables.
    palettestring, list, dict, or matplotlib.colors.Colormap

        Method for choosing the colors to use when mapping the hue semantic. String values are passed to color_palette(). List or dict values imply categorical mapping, while a colormap object implies numeric mapping.
    hue_ordervector of strings

        Specify the order of processing and plotting for categorical levels of the hue semantic.
    hue_normtuple or matplotlib.colors.Normalize

        Either a pair of values that set the normalization range in data units or an object that will map from data units into a [0, 1] interval. Usage implies numeric mapping.
    colormatplotlib color

        Single color specification for when hue mapping is not used. Otherwise, the plot will try to hook into the matplotlib property cycle.
    col_wrapint

        “Wrap” the column variable at this width, so that the column facets span multiple rows. Incompatible with a row facet.
    {row,col}_ordervector of strings

        Specify the order in which levels of the row and/or col variables appear in the grid of subplots.
    heightscalar

        Height (in inches) of each facet. See also: aspect.
    aspectscalar

        Aspect ratio of each facet, so that aspect * height gives the width of each facet in inches.
    facet_kwsdict

        Additional parameters passed to FacetGrid.
    kwargs

        Other keyword arguments are documented with the relevant axes-level function:

            histplot() (with kind="hist")

            kdeplot() (with kind="kde")

            ecdfplot() (with kind="ecdf")

Returns

    FacetGrid

        An object managing one or more subplots that correspond to conditional data subsets with convenient methods for batch-setting of axes attributes.
