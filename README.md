# file_tree_check
File checking project for McGill NeuroImaging lab

Given a directory, will explore recursively every directory and file under it while measuring their file size (for files) 
or the number of files directly under it (for folders).

Then, it will output a comparison between folder and files with similar name, in the form of plot distribution or statistics in a text file.
These information can be used to find outliers and problematic files in a directory were a regular structure in term of file count and file size is expected.
